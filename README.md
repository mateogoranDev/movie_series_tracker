# 🎬 Cine Tracker - Odoo 18 Module

![Cine Tracker Banner](static/description/cine_tracker_banner.png)

**Cine Tracker** is a custom module for **Odoo 18** designed for movie and TV series enthusiasts. It allows you to manage a personal multimedia catalog, classify works, rate them, and track what you've watched.

It features a **smart integration with the TMDB API (The Movie Database)** that automatically autocompletes genres (adding them as color tags), synopsis, release year, and downloads the official cover art with just the title.
